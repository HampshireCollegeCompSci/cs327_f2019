The Tutorial Command List uses the following format rules:

JSON structure:
{
	"commands": [
		{
			"argumentList": [
				"Command #1",
				"any additional instructions"
			],
		},
		{
			"argumentList": [
				"EndTutorial"
			]
		},
	]
}

All arguments will have their whitespace removed and changed to uppercase during interpretation.
Any errors encountered when interpreting the arguments will result in the tutorial freezing and an error being logged that includes what was expected.

Commands for the argumentList:
