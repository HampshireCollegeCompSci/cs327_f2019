READ ME:
The names of variables within the game are wrapped in quotation marks e.g, "reactorLimit"

Do not change the name of variable but only the values.

You can add more variables eventually all permanent game variables can go in here.

Key: Brackets([]) represent a list of values all assigned to one variable.
